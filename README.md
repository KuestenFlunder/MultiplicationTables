# Multiplication Tables Learning Program

## Description
The Multiplication Tables Learning Program is a simple, interactive JavaFX application aimed at helping users to learn and practice multiplication tables effectively. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can solve multiplication problems and receive instant feedback on their answers.

## Features
- **Dynamic Task Generation**: New multiplication tasks are generated randomly, giving a varied learning experience.
- **Progressive Difficulty Levels**: Users can progress through different levels, with the difficulty increasing at each level.
- **Instant Feedback**: Immediate feedback is provided for each answer, encouraging users to keep trying and improving.
- **Scoring System**: Users can track their progress with a scoring system that adjusts based on their performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Java (JDK 8 or later)
- JavaFX SDK

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/MultiplicationTablesLearningProgram.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd MultiplicationTablesLearningProgram
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Compile the application:
   ```sh
   javac -classpath path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -d out src/com/tjelvargames/mathlogic/*.java
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```sh
   java -classpath path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp out com.tjelvargames.mathlogic.MultiplicationTables
